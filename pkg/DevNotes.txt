implement realhrr_ramdb8: 8bit approximation for HRR ramdb memory
* all ordinary dreps stored as regular doubles
* 8bit fractional used for ramdb
* use 255 signed numbers with range +/-3 sd.
* sd = sqrt(1/n)
* scale * 127 = 3*sqrt(1/n)
* => scale = 3/127 * sqrt(1/n)
* xm is 8bit signed int, x is double version
* x = 3/127 * xm * sqrt(1/n)
